[Bug 1]
bug name: Unencrypted private data on-chain
number of bugs: 26
row number: 87 107 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 244 250 271 278 286 294 303 307 313 318 324 328 
additional description: It is a common misconception that private type variables cannot be read. 
Even if your contract is not published, attackers can look at contract 
transactions to determine values stored in the state of the contract. For
 this reason, it's important that unencrypted private data is not stored in
 the contract code or state.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 2]
bug name: DoS with block gas limit
number of bugs: 2
row number: 234 331 
additional description: When smart contracts are deployed or functions inside them are called, 
the execution of these actions always requires a certain amount of gas, 
based of how much computation is needed to complete them. The Ethereum 
network specifies a block gas limit and the sum of all transactions included
 in a block can not exceed the threshold. 
Bug level: warning 
detect method: We detect the existence of function calls, member variables, and constants that can cause looping costs of 67668 gases in conditional statements for / while (the limit is adjustable).

No unexpected ether balance.


No unchecked call return value.


No authorization through tx.origin.


No unsafe type inference.


[Bug 7]
bug name: Floating pragma
number of bugs: 1
row number: 1 
additional description: Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags 
that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to
 ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example,
 an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the 
contract system negatively.
Bug level: warning
Attention: Add the following statement to indicate the version of the security specification used: pragma experimental "vCompiler Version"

No block values as a proxy for time.


No integer division.


No locked ether.


No byte[].


No redundant refusal of payment.


[Bug 1ï¼“]
bug name: Style guide violation.
number of bugs: 15
row number: 3 6 87 244 250 271 278 286 294 303 307 313 318 324 328 
additional description: Solidity specifies how functions, events are named, and arrays are declared.
Compliance with specifications improves code readability.
Bug level: warning

No implicit visibility level.


No using fixed point number type.


No token API violation.


[Bug 17]
bug name: DoS with failed call
number of bugs: 1
row number: 336 
additional description: External calls can fail accidentally or deliberately, which can cause a DoS condition in the contract.
To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is better to isolate each external call into its own
transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments,
where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically (this also
reduces the chance of problems with the gas limit).
Bug level: warning

No missing constructor.


[Bug 19]
bug name: Public function that could be declared as external
number of bugs: 14
row number: 121 125 151 154 157 160 163 178 183 187 191 194 200 208 
additional description: Unused public functions in contracts can be declared external, which can reduce gas consumption.
Bug level: warning

No typographical error.


No outdated compiler version.


[Bug 22]
bug name: Use of deprecated solidity functions
number of bugs: 2
row number: 139 140 
additional description: Several functions and operators in Solidity are deprecated. 
Using them leads to reduced code quality. With new major versions
of the Solidity compiler, deprecated functions and operators may
result in side effects and compile errors. Please refer to https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-111 for details.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 23]
bug name: Transaction order dependence
number of bugs: 1
row number: 16 
additional description: Miners can decide which transactions are packaged into the blocks and the
order in which transactions are packaged. The current main impact of this
kind of bugs is the approve function in the ERC20 token standard.
Bug level: warning
