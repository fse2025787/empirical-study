[Bug 1]
bug name: Unencrypted private data on-chain
number of bugs: 6
row number: 284 285 288 444 445 577 
additional description: It is a common misconception that private type variables cannot be read. 
Even if your contract is not published, attackers can look at contract 
transactions to determine values stored in the state of the contract. For
 this reason, it's important that unencrypted private data is not stored in
 the contract code or state.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 2]
bug name: DoS with block gas limit
number of bugs: 14
row number: 149 229 409 410 411 412 413 520 526 541 550 559 578 629 
additional description: When smart contracts are deployed or functions inside them are called, 
the execution of these actions always requires a certain amount of gas, 
based of how much computation is needed to complete them. The Ethereum 
network specifies a block gas limit and the sum of all transactions included
 in a block can not exceed the threshold. 
Bug level: warning 
detect method: We detect the existence of function calls, member variables, and constants that can cause looping costs of 67668 gases in conditional statements for / while (the limit is adjustable).

No unexpected ether balance.


No unchecked call return value.


No authorization through tx.origin.


No unsafe type inference.


[Bug 7]
bug name: Floating pragma
number of bugs: 1
row number: 1 
additional description: Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags 
that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to
 ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example,
 an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the 
contract system negatively.
Bug level: warning
Attention: Add the following statement to indicate the version of the security specification used: pragma experimental "vCompiler Version"

No block values as a proxy for time.


No integer division.


[Bug 10]
bug name: Locked ether
number of bugs: 1
row number: 508 
additional description:  If the contract can receive ethers, but cannot send ethers, the
ethers in the contract will be permanently locked.
Bug level: error

No byte[].


No redundant refusal of payment.


[Bug 1ï¼“]
bug name: Style guide violation.
number of bugs: 7
row number: 29 180 357 362 513 577 597 
additional description: Solidity specifies how functions, events are named, and arrays are declared.
Compliance with specifications improves code readability.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 14]
bug name: Implicit visibility level
number of bugs: 18
row number: 68 69 83 84 126 127 128 129 131 132 133 134 136 137 138 139 142 449 
additional description: Functions that do not have a function visibility type specified
are public by default. This can lead to a vulnerability if a
developer forgot to set the visibility and a malicious user
is able to make unauthorized or unintended state changes.
And labeling the visibility explicitly makes it easier to 
catch incorrect assumptions about who can access the variable.
Bug level: warning

No using fixed point number type.


[Bug 16]
bug name: Token API violation.
number of bugs: 8
row number: 316 317 333 334 509 510 546 555 
additional description: In ERC20-compliant contracts, it does not recommend throwing exceptions in functions that return bool
values, such as approve, transfer, transferFrom.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 17]
bug name: DoS with failed call
number of bugs: 1
row number: 380 
additional description: External calls can fail accidentally or deliberately, which can cause a DoS condition in the contract.
To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is better to isolate each external call into its own
transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments,
where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically (this also
reduces the chance of problems with the gas limit).
Bug level: warning

[Bug 18]
bug name: Incorrect constructor name
number of bugs: 10
row number: 5 66 80 249 387 392 397 503 567 607 
additional description: Constructors are special functions that are called only once during the contract creation.
They often perform critical, privileged actions such as setting the owner of the contract.
 Before Solidity version 0.4.22, the only way of defining a constructor was to create a function
 with the same name as the contract class containing it. A function meant to become a constructor
becomes a normal, callable function if its name doesn't exactly match the contract name. This
behavior sometimes leads to security issues, in particular when smart contract code is re-used
with a different name but the name of the constructor function is not changed accordingly.
Bug level:error

[Bug 19]
bug name: Public function that could be declared as external
number of bugs: 35
row number: 42 57 61 71 75 87 101 104 108 112 115 148 156 162 168 174 208 212 241 310 324 460 463 470 505 519 524 533 540 549 558 563 570 585 628 
additional description: Unused public functions in contracts can be declared external, which can reduce gas consumption.
Bug level: warning

No typographical error.


[Bug 21]
bug name: Outdated Compiler Version
number of bugs: 1
row number: 1 
additional description: Using an outdated compiler version can be problematic especially if
there are publicly disclosed bugs and issues that affect the current
compiler version.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 22]
bug name: Use of deprecated solidity functions
number of bugs: 13
row number: 21 126 127 128 129 250 284 285 288 444 445 446 447 
additional description: Several functions and operators in Solidity are deprecated. 
Using them leads to reduced code quality. With new major versions
of the Solidity compiler, deprecated functions and operators may
result in side effects and compile errors. Please refer to https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-111 for details.
Bug level: warning

No transaction order dependence.
