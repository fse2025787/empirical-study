[Bug 1]
bug name: Unencrypted private data on-chain
number of bugs: 12
row number: 30 99 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 184 
additional description: It is a common misconception that private type variables cannot be read. 
Even if your contract is not published, attackers can look at contract 
transactions to determine values stored in the state of the contract. For
 this reason, it's important that unencrypted private data is not stored in
 the contract code or state.
Bug level: warning

No doS with block gas limit.


No unexpected ether balance.


No unchecked call return value.


No authorization through tx.origin.


No unsafe type inference.

 an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the 
contract system negatively.
Bug level: warning
Attention: Add the following statement to indicate the version of the security specification used: pragma experimental "vCompiler Version"

No block values as a proxy for time.


No integer division.
