[Bug 8]
bug name: Block values as a proxy for time
number of bugs: 6
row number: 266 279 325 327 401 434 
additional description: In the case of block.timestamp, developers often attempt to use it to trigger 
time-dependent events. As Ethereum is decentralized, nodes can synchronize time 
only to some degree. Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their 
blocks, especially if they can gain advantages by doing so. However, miners can't 
set a timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be rejected), 
nor can they set the timestamp too far ahead in the future. Taking all of the above 
into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of the provided timestamp.
Bug level: warning

No integer division.


No locked ether.


No byte[].


No redundant refusal of payment.


[Bug 1ï¼“]
bug name: Style guide violation.
number of bugs: 2
row number: 53 337 
additional description: Solidity specifies how functions, events are named, and arrays are declared.
Compliance with specifications improves code readability.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 14]
bug name: Implicit visibility level
number of bugs: 47
row number: 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 
additional description: Functions that do not have a function visibility type specified
are public by default. This can lead to a vulnerability if a
developer forgot to set the visibility and a malicious user
is able to make unauthorized or unintended state changes.
And labeling the visibility explicitly makes it easier to 
catch incorrect assumptions about who can access the variable.
Bug level: warning

No using fixed point number type.


No token API violation.


[Bug 17]
bug name: DoS with failed call
number of bugs: 1
row number: 266 
additional description: External calls can fail accidentally or deliberately, which can cause a DoS condition in the contract.
To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is better to isolate each external call into its own
transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments,
where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically (this also
reduces the chance of problems with the gas limit).
Bug level: warning

[Bug 18]
bug name: Incorrect constructor name
number of bugs: 1
row number: 365 
additional description: Constructors are special functions that are called only once during the contract creation.
They often perform critical, privileged actions such as setting the owner of the contract.
 Before Solidity version 0.4.22, the only way of defining a constructor was to create a function
 with the same name as the contract class containing it. A function meant to become a constructor
becomes a normal, callable function if its name doesn't exactly match the contract name. This
behavior sometimes leads to security issues, in particular when smart contract code is re-used
with a different name but the name of the constructor function is not changed accordingly.

[Bug 19]
bug name: Public function that could be declared as external
number of bugs: 56
row number: 133 136 139 142 145 148 151 154 157 160 163 166 169 172 175 178 181 183 185 189 191 193 195 197 199 201 203 205 207 209 211 213 215 217 219 221 223 225 227 229 231 233 235 237 239 241 243 245 247 249 251 253 255 257 324 330 
additional description: Unused public functions in contracts can be declared external, which can reduce gas consumption.
Bug level: warning

No typographical error.


No outdated compiler version.


[Bug 22]
bug name: Use of deprecated solidity functions
number of bugs: 37
row number: 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 296 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 
additional description: Several functions and operators in Solidity are deprecated. 
Using them leads to reduced code quality. With new major versions
of the Solidity compiler, deprecated functions and operators may
result in side effects and compile errors. Please refer to https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-111 for details.
Bug level: warning

No transaction order dependence.
