[Bug 1]
bug name: Unencrypted private data on-chain
number of bugs: 11
row number: 29 30 31 32 33 295 340 387 394 406 407 
additional description: It is a common misconception that private type variables cannot be read. 
Even if your contract is not published, attackers can look at contract 
transactions to determine values stored in the state of the contract. For
 this reason, it's important that unencrypted private data is not stored in
 the contract code or state.
Bug level: warning

No doS with block gas limit.


No unexpected ether balance.


No unchecked call return value.


No authorization through tx.origin.


No unsafe type inference.


[Bug 7]
bug name: Floating pragma
number of bugs: 11
row number: 1 10 21 27 129 143 212 224 260 282 290 
additional description: Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags 
that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to
 ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example,
 an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the 
contract system negatively.
Bug level: warning
Attention: Add the following statement to indicate the version of the security specification used: pragma experimental "vCompiler Version"

[Bug 8]
bug name: Block values as a proxy for time
number of bugs: 1
row number: 392 
additional description: In the case of block.timestamp, developers often attempt to use it to trigger 
time-dependent events. As Ethereum is decentralized, nodes can synchronize time 
only to some degree. Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their 
blocks, especially if they can gain advantages by doing so. However, miners can't 
set a timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be rejected), 
nor can they set the timestamp too far ahead in the future. Taking all of the above 
into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of the provided timestamp.
Bug level: warning

No integer division.


[Bug 10]
bug name: Locked ether
number of bugs: 1
row number: 265 
additional description:  If the contract can receive ethers, but cannot send ethers, the
ethers in the contract will be permanently locked.
Bug level: error

No byte[].


No redundant refusal of payment.


[Bug 1ï¼“]
bug name: Style guide violation.
number of bugs: 17
row number: 3 6 85 98 106 118 124 126 237 238 245 263 325 328 336 340 348 
additional description: Solidity specifies how functions, events are named, and arrays are declared.
Compliance with specifications improves code readability.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 14]
bug name: Implicit visibility level
number of bugs: 3
row number: 34 309 408 
additional description: Functions that do not have a function visibility type specified
are public by default. This can lead to a vulnerability if a
developer forgot to set the visibility and a malicious user
is able to make unauthorized or unintended state changes.
And labeling the visibility explicitly makes it easier to 
catch incorrect assumptions about who can access the variable.
Bug level: warning

No using fixed point number type.


[Bug 16]
bug name: Token API violation.
number of bugs: 1
row number: 67 
additional description: In ERC20-compliant contracts, it does not recommend throwing exceptions in functions that return bool
values, such as approve, transfer, transferFrom.
Bug level: warning

No dos by failed call.


No missing constructor.


[Bug 19]
bug name: Public function that could be declared as external
number of bugs: 8
row number: 38 41 44 47 64 73 77 134 
additional description: Unused public functions in contracts can be declared external, which can reduce gas consumption.
Bug level: warning

No typographical error.


No outdated compiler version.


No use of deprecated solidity functions.


[Bug 23]
bug name: Transaction order dependence
number of bugs: 2
row number: 16 234 
additional description: Miners can decide which transactions are packaged into the blocks and the
order in which transactions are packaged. The current main impact of this
kind of bugs is the approve function in the ERC20 token standard.
Bug level: warning
