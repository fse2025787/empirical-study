[Bug 1]
bug name: Unencrypted private data on-chain
number of bugs: 11
row number: 398 508 509 510 511 512 559 560 561 630 640 
additional description: It is a common misconception that private type variables cannot be read. 
Even if your contract is not published, attackers can look at contract 
transactions to determine values stored in the state of the contract. For
 this reason, it's important that unencrypted private data is not stored in
 the contract code or state.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 2]
bug name: DoS with block gas limit
number of bugs: 10
row number: 662 908 1025 1026 1103 1111 1160 1188 1192 1252 
additional description: When smart contracts are deployed or functions inside them are called, 
the execution of these actions always requires a certain amount of gas, 
based of how much computation is needed to complete them. The Ethereum 
network specifies a block gas limit and the sum of all transactions included
 in a block can not exceed the threshold. 
Bug level: warning 
detect method: We detect the existence of function calls, member variables, and constants that can cause looping costs of 67668 gases in conditional statements for / while (the limit is adjustable).

No unexpected ether balance.


[Bug 4]
bug name: Unchecked call return value
number of bugs: 3
row number: 540 544 548 
additional description: The return value of a message call is not checked. Execution will resume even 
if the called contract throws an exception. If the call fails accidentally or 
an attacker forces the call to fail, this may cause unexpected behaviour in the
 subsequent program logic.
Bug level:error 

No authorization through tx.origin.


No unsafe type inference.


[Bug 7]
bug name: Floating pragma
number of bugs: 1
row number: 1 
additional description: Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags 
that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to
 ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example,
 an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the 
contract system negatively.
Bug level: warning
Attention: Add the following statement to indicate the version of the security specification used: pragma experimental "vCompiler Version"

[Bug 8]
bug name: Block values as a proxy for time
number of bugs: 10
row number: 749 760 769 779 788 798 828 835 871 876 
additional description: In the case of block.timestamp, developers often attempt to use it to trigger 
time-dependent events. As Ethereum is decentralized, nodes can synchronize time 
only to some degree. Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their 
blocks, especially if they can gain advantages by doing so. However, miners can't 
set a timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be rejected), 
nor can they set the timestamp too far ahead in the future. Taking all of the above 
into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of the provided timestamp.
Bug level: warning

No integer division.


[Bug 10]
bug name: Locked ether
number of bugs: 1
row number: 368 
additional description:  If the contract can receive ethers, but cannot send ethers, the
ethers in the contract will be permanently locked.
Bug level: error

No byte[].


No redundant refusal of payment.


[Bug 1ï¼“]
bug name: Style guide violation.
number of bugs: 8
row number: 5 37 618 624 630 640 1075 1258 
additional description: Solidity specifies how functions, events are named, and arrays are declared.
Compliance with specifications improves code readability.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 14]
bug name: Implicit visibility level
number of bugs: 100
row number: 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 370 371 372 373 374 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 389 390 391 392 393 454 455 456 507 562 616 658 685 687 688 689 705 706 707 708 709 710 711 712 713 714 715 716 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 860 861 862 863 881 882 883 884 885 886 887 888 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 961 984 985 986 987 988 989 1037 1041 1042 1043 1044 1045 1046 1061 1086 1264 1265 1266 1267 1268 1269 1270 1289 
additional description: Functions that do not have a function visibility type specified
are public by default. This can lead to a vulnerability if a
developer forgot to set the visibility and a malicious user
is able to make unauthorized or unintended state changes.
And labeling the visibility explicitly makes it easier to 
catch incorrect assumptions about who can access the variable.
Bug level: warning

No using fixed point number type.


No token API violation.


[Bug 17]
bug name: DoS with failed call
number of bugs: 11
row number: 304 541 545 549 677 1162 1176 1177 1208 1216 1300 
additional description: External calls can fail accidentally or deliberately, which can cause a DoS condition in the contract.
To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is better to isolate each external call into its own
transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments,
where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically (this also
reduces the chance of problems with the gas limit).
Bug level: warning

[Bug 18]
bug name: Incorrect constructor name
number of bugs: 1
row number: 1262 
additional description: Constructors are special functions that are called only once during the contract creation.
They often perform critical, privileged actions such as setting the owner of the contract.
 Before Solidity version 0.4.22, the only way of defining a constructor was to create a function
 with the same name as the contract class containing it. A function meant to become a constructor
becomes a normal, callable function if its name doesn't exactly match the contract name. This
behavior sometimes leads to security issues, in particular when smart contract code is re-used
with a different name but the name of the constructor function is not changed accordingly.
Bug level:error

[Bug 19]
bug name: Public function that could be declared as external
number of bugs: 5
row number: 814 890 929 1244 1247 
additional description: Unused public functions in contracts can be declared external, which can reduce gas consumption.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 20]
bug name: Typographical error
number of bugs: 3
row number: 120 121 226 
additional description: Users can use =+ and =- operators in the integer operation
without compiling errors (up to and including version 0.4.26)
Bug level: error

No outdated compiler version.


[Bug 22]
bug name: Use of deprecated solidity functions
number of bugs: 22
row number: 120 121 122 123 253 291 292 452 508 509 510 511 512 559 560 610 611 612 685 1041 1042 1043 
additional description: Several functions and operators in Solidity are deprecated. 
Using them leads to reduced code quality. With new major versions
of the Solidity compiler, deprecated functions and operators may
result in side effects and compile errors. Please refer to https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-111 for details.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 23]
bug name: Transaction order dependence
number of bugs: 1
row number: 533 
additional description: Miners can decide which transactions are packaged into the blocks and the
order in which transactions are packaged. The current main impact of this
kind of bugs is the approve function in the ERC20 token standard.
Bug level: warning
