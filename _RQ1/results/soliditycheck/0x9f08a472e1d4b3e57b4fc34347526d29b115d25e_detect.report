[Bug 1]
bug name: Unencrypted private data on-chain
number of bugs: 37
row number: 3 4 5 18 19 76 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 219 234 251 272 359 364 428 451 650 653 
additional description: It is a common misconception that private type variables cannot be read. 
Even if your contract is not published, attackers can look at contract 
transactions to determine values stored in the state of the contract. For
 this reason, it's important that unencrypted private data is not stored in
 the contract code or state.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 2]
bug name: DoS with block gas limit
number of bugs: 9
row number: 322 340 500 536 560 586 593 612 635 
additional description: When smart contracts are deployed or functions inside them are called, 
the execution of these actions always requires a certain amount of gas, 
based of how much computation is needed to complete them. The Ethereum 
network specifies a block gas limit and the sum of all transactions included
 in a block can not exceed the threshold. 
Bug level: warning 
detect method: We detect the existence of function calls, member variables, and constants that can cause looping costs of 67668 gases in conditional statements for / while (the limit is adjustable).

No unexpected ether balance.


No unchecked call return value.


No authorization through tx.origin.


No unsafe type inference.


[Bug 7]
bug name: Floating pragma
number of bugs: 10
row number: 1 16 65 74 104 145 475 483 576 658 
additional description: Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags 
that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to
 ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example,
 an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the 
contract system negatively.
Bug level: warning
Attention: Add the following statement to indicate the version of the security specification used: pragma experimental "vCompiler Version"

No block values as a proxy for time.


No integer division.


[Bug 10]
bug name: Locked ether
number of bugs: 1
row number: 675 
additional description:  If the contract can receive ethers, but cannot send ethers, the
ethers in the contract will be permanently locked.
Bug level: error

No byte[].


No redundant refusal of payment.


[Bug 1ï¼“]
bug name: Style guide violation.
number of bugs: 40
row number: 67 70 88 98 176 179 187 192 202 205 208 211 219 234 240 243 248 251 269 272 305 308 311 327 345 359 364 395 398 428 442 451 455 457 459 461 464 650 653 711 
additional description: Solidity specifies how functions, events are named, and arrays are declared.
Compliance with specifications improves code readability.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 14]
bug name: Implicit visibility level
number of bugs: 8
row number: 6 78 121 122 123 124 171 672 
additional description: Functions that do not have a function visibility type specified
are public by default. This can lead to a vulnerability if a
developer forgot to set the visibility and a malicious user
is able to make unauthorized or unintended state changes.
And labeling the visibility explicitly makes it easier to 
catch incorrect assumptions about who can access the variable.
Bug level: warning

No using fixed point number type.


[Bug 16]
bug name: Token API violation.
number of bugs: 4
row number: 279 370 372 373 
additional description: In ERC20-compliant contracts, it does not recommend throwing exceptions in functions that return bool
values, such as approve, transfer, transferFrom.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 17]
bug name: DoS with failed call
number of bugs: 1
row number: 739 
additional description: External calls can fail accidentally or deliberately, which can cause a DoS condition in the contract.
To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is better to isolate each external call into its own
transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments,
where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically (this also
reduces the chance of problems with the gas limit).
Bug level: warning

No missing constructor.


[Bug 19]
bug name: Public function that could be declared as external
number of bugs: 15
row number: 91 94 195 258 261 264 276 284 288 293 693 696 701 707 735 
additional description: Unused public functions in contracts can be declared external, which can reduce gas consumption.
Bug level: warning

No typographical error.


No outdated compiler version.


[Bug 22]
bug name: Use of deprecated solidity functions
number of bugs: 17
row number: 3 4 18 19 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 
additional description: Several functions and operators in Solidity are deprecated. 
Using them leads to reduced code quality. With new major versions
of the Solidity compiler, deprecated functions and operators may
result in side effects and compile errors. Please refer to https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-111 for details.
Bug level: warning

No transaction order dependence.
