[Bug 1]
bug name: Unencrypted private data on-chain
number of bugs: 8
row number: 74 104 105 106 107 108 836 920 
additional description: It is a common misconception that private type variables cannot be read. 
Even if your contract is not published, attackers can look at contract 
transactions to determine values stored in the state of the contract. For
 this reason, it's important that unencrypted private data is not stored in
 the contract code or state.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 2]
bug name: DoS with block gas limit
number of bugs: 5
row number: 193 205 273 286 389 
additional description: When smart contracts are deployed or functions inside them are called, 
the execution of these actions always requires a certain amount of gas, 
based of how much computation is needed to complete them. The Ethereum 
network specifies a block gas limit and the sum of all transactions included
 in a block can not exceed the threshold. 
Bug level: warning 
detect method: We detect the existence of function calls, member variables, and constants that can cause looping costs of 67668 gases in conditional statements for / while (the limit is adjustable).

No unexpected ether balance.


[Bug 4]
bug name: Unchecked call return value
number of bugs: 1
row number: 917 
additional description: The return value of a message call is not checked. Execution will resume even 
if the called contract throws an exception. If the call fails accidentally or 
an attacker forces the call to fail, this may cause unexpected behaviour in the
 subsequent program logic.
Bug level:error 

No authorization through tx.origin.


No unsafe type inference.


[Bug 7]
bug name: Floating pragma
number of bugs: 17
row number: 3 68 72 82 90 94 460 648 664 677 682 727 788 803 814 843 872 
additional description: Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags 
that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to
 ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example,
 an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the 
contract system negatively.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 8]
bug name: Block values as a proxy for time
number of bugs: 27
row number: 157 158 160 161 176 177 179 180 196 200 235 248 259 267 343 350 361 374 381 384 404 409 419 426 428 434 436 
additional description: In the case of block.timestamp, developers often attempt to use it to trigger 
time-dependent events. As Ethereum is decentralized, nodes can synchronize time 
only to some degree. Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their 
blocks, especially if they can gain advantages by doing so. However, miners can't 
set a timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be rejected), 
nor can they set the timestamp too far ahead in the future. Taking all of the above 
into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of the provided timestamp.
Bug level: warning

No integer division.


[Bug 10]
bug name: Locked ether
number of bugs: 1
row number: 661 
additional description:  If the contract can receive ethers, but cannot send ethers, the
ethers in the contract will be permanently locked.
Bug level: error

No byte[].


No redundant refusal of payment.


[Bug 1ï¼“]
bug name: Style guide violation.
number of bugs: 2
row number: 836 920 
additional description: Solidity specifies how functions, events are named, and arrays are declared.
Compliance with specifications improves code readability.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 14]
bug name: Implicit visibility level
number of bugs: 188
row number: 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 15 16 17 18 21 22 23 24 25 26 29 30 31 140 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 511 512 513 514 515 518 519 520 521 522 523 526 527 528 529 532 533 534 535 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 553 554 555 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 567 568 569 570 571 574 575 576 577 578 579 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 604 605 606 607 610 611 612 613 614 615 618 619 620 621 622 623 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 651 652 653 654 655 656 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 846 847 848 849 850 851 854 855 856 857 858 861 862 863 864 
additional description: Functions that do not have a function visibility type specified
are public by default. This can lead to a vulnerability if a
developer forgot to set the visibility and a malicious user
is able to make unauthorized or unintended state changes.
And labeling the visibility explicitly makes it easier to 
catch incorrect assumptions about who can access the variable.
Bug level: warning

No using fixed point number type.


No token API violation.


[Bug 17]
bug name: DoS with failed call
number of bugs: 5
row number: 129 359 408 825 839 
additional description: External calls can fail accidentally or deliberately, which can cause a DoS condition in the contract.
To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is better to isolate each external call into its own
transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments,
where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically (this also
reduces the chance of problems with the gas limit).
Bug level: warning

No missing constructor.


[Bug 19]
bug name: Public function that could be declared as external
number of bugs: 2
row number: 271 454 
additional description: Unused public functions in contracts can be declared external, which can reduce gas consumption.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 20]
bug name: Typographical error
number of bugs: 1
row number: 701 
additional description: Users can use =+ and =- operators in the integer operation
without compiling errors (up to and including version 0.4.26)
Bug level: error

[Bug 21]
bug name: Outdated Compiler Version
number of bugs: 1
row number: 682 
additional description: Using an outdated compiler version can be problematic especially if
there are publicly disclosed bugs and issues that affect the current
compiler version.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 22]
bug name: Use of deprecated solidity functions
number of bugs: 2
row number: 107 108 
additional description: Several functions and operators in Solidity are deprecated. 
Using them leads to reduced code quality. With new major versions
of the Solidity compiler, deprecated functions and operators may
result in side effects and compile errors. Please refer to https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-111 for details.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 23]
bug name: Transaction order dependence
number of bugs: 1
row number: 809 
additional description: Miners can decide which transactions are packaged into the blocks and the
order in which transactions are packaged. The current main impact of this
kind of bugs is the approve function in the ERC20 token standard.
Bug level: warning
