[Bug 1]
bug name: Unencrypted private data on-chain
number of bugs: 12
row number: 60 111 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 186 205 210 
additional description: It is a common misconception that private type variables cannot be read. 
Even if your contract is not published, attackers can look at contract 
transactions to determine values stored in the state of the contract. For
 this reason, it's important that unencrypted private data is not stored in
 the contract code or state.
Bug level: warning
