[Bug 1]
bug name: Unencrypted private data on-chain
number of bugs: 26
row number: 3 4 17 46 53 76 83 88 91 121 148 152 153 154 167 172 173 174 175 176 177 259 480 574 680 727 
additional description: It is a common misconception that private type variables cannot be read. 
Even if your contract is not published, attackers can look at contract 
transactions to determine values stored in the state of the contract. For
 this reason, it's important that unencrypted private data is not stored in
 the contract code or state.
Bug level: warning

No doS with block gas limit.


No unexpected ether balance.


No unchecked call return value.


No authorization through tx.origin.


No unsafe type inference.


[Bug 7]
bug name: Floating pragma
number of bugs: 14
row number: 21 48 96 119 150 169 261 472 572 586 597 658 687 32 
additional description: Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags 
that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to
 ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example,
 an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the 
contract system negatively.
Bug level: warning
Attention: Add the following statement to indicate the version of the security specification used: pragma experimental "vCompiler Version"

[Bug 8]
bug name: Block values as a proxy for time
number of bugs: 11
row number: 295 299 434 438 445 455 459 463 464 524 525 
additional description: In the case of block.timestamp, developers often attempt to use it to trigger 
time-dependent events. As Ethereum is decentralized, nodes can synchronize time 
only to some degree. Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their 
blocks, especially if they can gain advantages by doing so. However, miners can't 
set a timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be rejected), 
nor can they set the timestamp too far ahead in the future. Taking all of the above 
into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of the provided timestamp.
Bug level: warning

No integer division.


[Bug 10]
bug name: Locked ether
number of bugs: 1
row number: 593 
additional description:  If the contract can receive ethers, but cannot send ethers, the
ethers in the contract will be permanently locked.
Bug level: error

No byte[].


No redundant refusal of payment.


[Bug 1ï¼“]
bug name: Style guide violation.
number of bugs: 37
row number: 17 34 37 39 42 61 69 75 76 83 88 91 123 127 155 158 178 182 226 234 241 248 254 257 286 428 429 430 448 468 481 536 551 570 582 680 727 
additional description: Solidity specifies how functions, events are named, and arrays are declared.
Compliance with specifications improves code readability.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 14]
bug name: Implicit visibility level
number of bugs: 8
row number: 272 273 274 275 278 279 280 281 
additional description: Functions that do not have a function visibility type specified
are public by default. This can lead to a vulnerability if a
developer forgot to set the visibility and a malicious user
is able to make unauthorized or unintended state changes.
And labeling the visibility explicitly makes it easier to 
catch incorrect assumptions about who can access the variable.
Bug level: warning

No using fixed point number type.


No token API violation.


[Bug 17]
bug name: DoS with failed call
number of bugs: 2
row number: 669 683 
additional description: External calls can fail accidentally or deliberately, which can cause a DoS condition in the contract.
To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is better to isolate each external call into its own
transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments,
where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically (this also
reduces the chance of problems with the gas limit).
Bug level: warning

[Bug 18]
bug name: Incorrect constructor name
number of bugs: 2
row number: 170 573 
additional description: Constructors are special functions that are called only once during the contract creation.
They often perform critical, privileged actions such as setting the owner of the contract.
 Before Solidity version 0.4.22, the only way of defining a constructor was to create a function
 with the same name as the contract class containing it. A function meant to become a constructor
becomes a normal, callable function if its name doesn't exactly match the contract name. This
behavior sometimes leads to security issues, in particular when smart contract code is re-used
with a different name but the name of the constructor function is not changed accordingly.
Bug level:error

[Bug 19]
bug name: Public function that could be declared as external
number of bugs: 10
row number: 139 143 187 190 193 213 218 222 395 579 
additional description: Unused public functions in contracts can be declared external, which can reduce gas consumption.
Bug level: warning

No typographical error.


[Bug 21]
bug name: Outdated Compiler Version
number of bugs: 1
row number: 1 
additional description: Using an outdated compiler version can be problematic especially if
there are publicly disclosed bugs and issues that affect the current
compiler version.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 22]
bug name: Use of deprecated solidity functions
number of bugs: 8
row number: 52 53 152 153 267 268 269 270 
additional description: Several functions and operators in Solidity are deprecated. 
Using them leads to reduced code quality. With new major versions
of the Solidity compiler, deprecated functions and operators may
result in side effects and compile errors. Please refer to https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-111 for details.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 23]
bug name: Transaction order dependence
number of bugs: 1
row number: 27 
additional description: Miners can decide which transactions are packaged into the blocks and the
order in which transactions are packaged. The current main impact of this
kind of bugs is the approve function in the ERC20 token standard.
Bug level: warning
