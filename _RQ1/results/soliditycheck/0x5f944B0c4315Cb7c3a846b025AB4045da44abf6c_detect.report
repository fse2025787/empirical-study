[Bug 1]
bug name: Unencrypted private data on-chain
number of bugs: 6
row number: 29 30 31 32 33 142 
additional description: It is a common misconception that private type variables cannot be read. 
Even if your contract is not published, attackers can look at contract 
transactions to determine values stored in the state of the contract. For
 this reason, it's important that unencrypted private data is not stored in
 the contract code or state.
Bug level: warning

No doS with block gas limit.


No unexpected ether balance.


No unchecked call return value.


No authorization through tx.origin.


No unsafe type inference.


[Bug 7]
bug name: Floating pragma
number of bugs: 7
row number: 1 12 18 27 129 140 153 
additional description: Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags 
that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to
 ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example,
 an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the 
contract system negatively.
Bug level: warning
Attention: Add the following statement to indicate the version of the security specification used: pragma experimental "vCompiler Version"

No block values as a proxy for time.


No integer division.


No locked ether.


No byte[].


No redundant refusal of payment.


[Bug 1ï¼“]
bug name: Style guide violation.
number of bugs: 8
row number: 20 23 85 98 106 118 124 126 
additional description: Solidity specifies how functions, events are named, and arrays are declared.
Compliance with specifications improves code readability.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 14]
bug name: Implicit visibility level
number of bugs: 4
row number: 34 134 143 155 
additional description: Functions that do not have a function visibility type specified
are public by default. This can lead to a vulnerability if a
developer forgot to set the visibility and a malicious user
is able to make unauthorized or unintended state changes.
And labeling the visibility explicitly makes it easier to 
catch incorrect assumptions about who can access the variable.
Bug level: warning

No using fixed point number type.


[Bug 16]
bug name: Token API violation.
number of bugs: 1
row number: 67 
additional description: In ERC20-compliant contracts, it does not recommend throwing exceptions in functions that return bool
values, such as approve, transfer, transferFrom.
Bug level: warning

No dos by failed call.


No missing constructor.


[Bug 19]
bug name: Public function that could be declared as external
number of bugs: 10
row number: 38 41 44 47 50 64 73 77 146 149 
additional description: Unused public functions in contracts can be declared external, which can reduce gas consumption.
Bug level: warning

No typographical error.


No outdated compiler version.


[Bug 22]
bug name: Use of deprecated solidity functions
number of bugs: 1
row number: 142 
additional description: Several functions and operators in Solidity are deprecated. 
Using them leads to reduced code quality. With new major versions
of the Solidity compiler, deprecated functions and operators may
result in side effects and compile errors. Please refer to https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-111 for details.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 23]
bug name: Transaction order dependence
number of bugs: 1
row number: 7 
additional description: Miners can decide which transactions are packaged into the blocks and the
order in which transactions are packaged. The current main impact of this
kind of bugs is the approve function in the ERC20 token standard.
Bug level: warning
