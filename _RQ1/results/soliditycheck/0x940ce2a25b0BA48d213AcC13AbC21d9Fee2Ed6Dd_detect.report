[Bug 2]
bug name: DoS with block gas limit
number of bugs: 2
row number: 1328 1336 
additional description: When smart contracts are deployed or functions inside them are called, 
the execution of these actions always requires a certain amount of gas, 
based of how much computation is needed to complete them. The Ethereum 
network specifies a block gas limit and the sum of all transactions included
 in a block can not exceed the threshold. 
Bug level: warning 
detect method: We detect the existence of function calls, member variables, and constants that can cause looping costs of 67668 gases in conditional statements for / while (the limit is adjustable).

No unexpected ether balance.


No unchecked call return value.


No authorization through tx.origin.


No unsafe type inference.


[Bug 7]
bug name: Floating pragma
number of bugs: 12
row number: 1 31 138 457 1012 1017 1111 1132 1146 1157 1173 1179 
additional description: Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags 
that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to
 ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example,
 an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the 
contract system negatively.
Bug level: warning
Attention: Add the following statement to indicate the version of the security specification used: pragma experimental "vCompiler Version"

[Bug 8]
bug name: Block values as a proxy for time
number of bugs: 1
row number: 533 
additional description: In the case of block.timestamp, developers often attempt to use it to trigger 
time-dependent events. As Ethereum is decentralized, nodes can synchronize time 
only to some degree. Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their 
blocks, especially if they can gain advantages by doing so. However, miners can't 
set a timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be rejected), 
nor can they set the timestamp too far ahead in the future. Taking all of the above 
into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of the provided timestamp.
Bug level: warning

No integer division.


No locked ether.


No byte[].


No redundant refusal of payment.


[Bug 1ï¼“]
bug name: Style guide violation.
number of bugs: 31
row number: 113 114 115 116 117 118 868 877 889 899 906 921 929 941 948 968 975 1007 1049 1097 1101 1104 1105 1108 1109 1208 1209 1216 1325 1333 1341 
additional description: Solidity specifies how functions, events are named, and arrays are declared.
Compliance with specifications improves code readability.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 14]
bug name: Implicit visibility level
number of bugs: 27
row number: 23 24 140 141 142 143 145 148 624 625 626 627 628 670 671 672 673 674 721 722 723 765 766 767 768 769 770 
additional description: Functions that do not have a function visibility type specified
are public by default. This can lead to a vulnerability if a
developer forgot to set the visibility and a malicious user
is able to make unauthorized or unintended state changes.
And labeling the visibility explicitly makes it easier to 
catch incorrect assumptions about who can access the variable.
Bug level: warning

No using fixed point number type.


No token API violation.


[Bug 17]
bug name: DoS with failed call
number of bugs: 4
row number: 818 836 894 984 
additional description: External calls can fail accidentally or deliberately, which can cause a DoS condition in the contract.
To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is better to isolate each external call into its own
transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments,
where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically (this also
reduces the chance of problems with the gas limit).
Bug level: warning

[Bug 18]
bug name: Incorrect constructor name
number of bugs: 19
row number: 2 28 32 78 120 123 139 458 999 1009 1013 1018 1088 1099 1103 1107 1112 1158 1174 
additional description: Constructors are special functions that are called only once during the contract creation.
They often perform critical, privileged actions such as setting the owner of the contract.
 Before Solidity version 0.4.22, the only way of defining a constructor was to create a function
 with the same name as the contract class containing it. A function meant to become a constructor
becomes a normal, callable function if its name doesn't exactly match the contract name. This
behavior sometimes leads to security issues, in particular when smart contract code is re-used
with a different name but the name of the constructor function is not changed accordingly.
Bug level:error

[Bug 19]
bug name: Public function that could be declared as external
number of bugs: 2
row number: 968 1258 
additional description: Unused public functions in contracts can be declared external, which can reduce gas consumption.
Bug level: warning

No typographical error.


No outdated compiler version.


[Bug 22]
bug name: Use of deprecated solidity functions
number of bugs: 15
row number: 7 8 79 140 141 142 143 1014 1113 1175 1236 1245 1246 1247 1248 
additional description: Several functions and operators in Solidity are deprecated. 
Using them leads to reduced code quality. With new major versions
of the Solidity compiler, deprecated functions and operators may
result in side effects and compile errors. Please refer to https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-111 for details.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 23]
bug name: Transaction order dependence
number of bugs: 5
row number: 98 508 1141 1152 1205 
additional description: Miners can decide which transactions are packaged into the blocks and the
order in which transactions are packaged. The current main impact of this
kind of bugs is the approve function in the ERC20 token standard.
Bug level: warning
