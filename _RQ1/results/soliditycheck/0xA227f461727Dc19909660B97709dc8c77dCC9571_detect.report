[Bug 1]
bug name: Unencrypted private data on-chain
number of bugs: 12
row number: 49 86 88 89 90 91 92 93 220 240 261 401 
additional description: It is a common misconception that private type variables cannot be read. 
Even if your contract is not published, attackers can look at contract 
transactions to determine values stored in the state of the contract. For
 this reason, it's important that unencrypted private data is not stored in
 the contract code or state.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 2]
bug name: DoS with block gas limit
number of bugs: 6
row number: 112 143 212 253 332 383 
additional description: When smart contracts are deployed or functions inside them are called, 
the execution of these actions always requires a certain amount of gas, 
based of how much computation is needed to complete them. The Ethereum 
network specifies a block gas limit and the sum of all transactions included
 in a block can not exceed the threshold. 
Bug level: warning 
detect method: We detect the existence of function calls, member variables, and constants that can cause looping costs of 67668 gases in conditional statements for / while (the limit is adjustable).

No unexpected ether balance.


[Bug 4]
bug name: Unchecked call return value
number of bugs: 1
row number: 489 
additional description: The return value of a message call is not checked. Execution will resume even 
if the called contract throws an exception. If the call fails accidentally or 
an attacker forces the call to fail, this may cause unexpected behaviour in the
 subsequent program logic.
Bug level:error 

[Bug 5]
bug name: Authorization through tx.origin
number of bugs: 2
row number: 307 318 
additional description: tx.origin is a global variable in Solidity which returns the 
address of the account that sent the transaction. Using the variable
 for authorization could make a contract vulnerable if an authorized
 account calls into a malicious contract. A call could be made to the
 vulnerable contract that passes the authorization check since tx.origin
 returns the original sender of the transaction which in this case is the
 authorized account.
Bug level: error

No unsafe type inference.


[Bug 7]
bug name: Floating pragma
number of bugs: 13
row number: 1 5 20 29 35 41 47 74 285 376 395 399 444 
additional description: Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags 
that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to
 ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example,
 an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the 
contract system negatively.
Bug level: warning
Attention: Add the following statement to indicate the version of the security specification used: pragma experimental "vCompiler Version"

[Bug 8]
bug name: Block values as a proxy for time
number of bugs: 2
row number: 210 230 
additional description: In the case of block.timestamp, developers often attempt to use it to trigger 
time-dependent events. As Ethereum is decentralized, nodes can synchronize time 
only to some degree. Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their 
blocks, especially if they can gain advantages by doing so. However, miners can't 
set a timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be rejected), 
nor can they set the timestamp too far ahead in the future. Taking all of the above 
into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of the provided timestamp.
Bug level: warning

No integer division.


No locked ether.


No byte[].


No redundant refusal of payment.


[Bug 1ï¼“]
bug name: Style guide violation.
number of bugs: 15
row number: 22 25 68 133 165 196 199 202 220 240 245 261 280 282 372 
additional description: Solidity specifies how functions, events are named, and arrays are declared.
Compliance with specifications improves code readability.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 14]
bug name: Implicit visibility level
number of bugs: 9
row number: 51 79 80 83 84 94 293 294 299 
additional description: Functions that do not have a function visibility type specified
are public by default. This can lead to a vulnerability if a
developer forgot to set the visibility and a malicious user
is able to make unauthorized or unintended state changes.
And labeling the visibility explicitly makes it easier to 
catch incorrect assumptions about who can access the variable.
Bug level: warning

No using fixed point number type.


[Bug 16]
bug name: Token API violation.
number of bugs: 2
row number: 170 171 
additional description: In ERC20-compliant contracts, it does not recommend throwing exceptions in functions that return bool
values, such as approve, transfer, transferFrom.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 17]
bug name: DoS with failed call
number of bugs: 2
row number: 262 324 
additional description: External calls can fail accidentally or deliberately, which can cause a DoS condition in the contract.
To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is better to isolate each external call into its own
transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments,
where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically (this also
reduces the chance of problems with the gas limit).
Bug level: warning

No missing constructor.


[Bug 19]
bug name: Public function that could be declared as external
number of bugs: 22
row number: 43 61 64 103 107 126 151 154 157 160 178 186 316 329 336 341 345 356 359 362 365 368 
additional description: Unused public functions in contracts can be declared external, which can reduce gas consumption.
Bug level: warning

No typographical error.


No outdated compiler version.


[Bug 22]
bug name: Use of deprecated solidity functions
number of bugs: 1
row number: 401 
additional description: Several functions and operators in Solidity are deprecated. 
Using them leads to reduced code quality. With new major versions
of the Solidity compiler, deprecated functions and operators may
result in side effects and compile errors. Please refer to https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-111 for details.
Bug level: warning

No transaction order dependence.
