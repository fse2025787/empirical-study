[Bug 1]
bug name: Unencrypted private data on-chain
number of bugs: 8
row number: 15 16 23 221 229 241 258 277 
additional description: It is a common misconception that private type variables cannot be read. 
Even if your contract is not published, attackers can look at contract 
transactions to determine values stored in the state of the contract. For
 this reason, it's important that unencrypted private data is not stored in
 the contract code or state.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 2]
bug name: DoS with block gas limit
number of bugs: 3
row number: 182 335 348 
additional description: When smart contracts are deployed or functions inside them are called, 
the execution of these actions always requires a certain amount of gas, 
based of how much computation is needed to complete them. The Ethereum 
network specifies a block gas limit and the sum of all transactions included
 in a block can not exceed the threshold. 
Bug level: warning 
detect method: We detect the existence of function calls, member variables, and constants that can cause looping costs of 67668 gases in conditional statements for / while (the limit is adjustable).

No unexpected ether balance.


No unchecked call return value.


No authorization through tx.origin.


No unsafe type inference.


[Bug 7]
bug name: Floating pragma
number of bugs: 1
row number: 1 
additional description: Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags 
that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to
 ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example,
 an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the 
contract system negatively.
Bug level: warning
Attention: Add the following statement to indicate the version of the security specification used: pragma experimental "vCompiler Version"

[Bug 8]
bug name: Block values as a proxy for time
number of bugs: 12
row number: 69 109 131 133 138 159 161 169 179 191 211 270 
additional description: In the case of block.timestamp, developers often attempt to use it to trigger 
time-dependent events. As Ethereum is decentralized, nodes can synchronize time 
only to some degree. Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their 
blocks, especially if they can gain advantages by doing so. However, miners can't 
set a timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be rejected), 
nor can they set the timestamp too far ahead in the future. Taking all of the above 
into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of the provided timestamp.
Bug level: warning

No integer division.


No locked ether.


No byte[].


No redundant refusal of payment.


[Bug 1ï¼“]
bug name: Style guide violation.
number of bugs: 10
row number: 3 4 5 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 
additional description: Solidity specifies how functions, events are named, and arrays are declared.
Compliance with specifications improves code readability.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 14]
bug name: Implicit visibility level
number of bugs: 22
row number: 19 20 53 287 288 289 290 291 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 303 304 305 306 309 310 311 
additional description: Functions that do not have a function visibility type specified
are public by default. This can lead to a vulnerability if a
developer forgot to set the visibility and a malicious user
is able to make unauthorized or unintended state changes.
And labeling the visibility explicitly makes it easier to 
catch incorrect assumptions about who can access the variable.
Bug level: warning

No using fixed point number type.


No token API violation.


No dos by failed call.


No missing constructor.


[Bug 19]
bug name: Public function that could be declared as external
number of bugs: 17
row number: 57 60 64 82 89 95 102 111 116 141 164 171 197 201 204 207 210 
additional description: Unused public functions in contracts can be declared external, which can reduce gas consumption.
Bug level: warning

No typographical error.


[Bug 21]
bug name: Outdated Compiler Version
number of bugs: 1
row number: 1 
additional description: Using an outdated compiler version can be problematic especially if
there are publicly disclosed bugs and issues that affect the current
compiler version.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 22]
bug name: Use of deprecated solidity functions
number of bugs: 4
row number: 17 18 19 20 
additional description: Several functions and operators in Solidity are deprecated. 
Using them leads to reduced code quality. With new major versions
of the Solidity compiler, deprecated functions and operators may
result in side effects and compile errors. Please refer to https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-111 for details.
Bug level: warning

No transaction order dependence.
