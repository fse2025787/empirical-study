[Bug 7]
bug name: Floating pragma
number of bugs: 1
row number: 1 
additional description: Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags 
that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to
 ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example,
 an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the 
contract system negatively.
Bug level: warning
Attention: Add the following statement to indicate the version of the security specification used: pragma experimental "vCompiler Version"

[Bug 8]
bug name: Block values as a proxy for time
number of bugs: 9
row number: 201 202 208 221 252 263 272 273 302 
additional description: In the case of block.timestamp, developers often attempt to use it to trigger 
time-dependent events. As Ethereum is decentralized, nodes can synchronize time 
only to some degree. Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their 
blocks, especially if they can gain advantages by doing so. However, miners can't 
set a timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be rejected), 
nor can they set the timestamp too far ahead in the future. Taking all of the above 
into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of the provided timestamp.
Bug level: warning

No integer division.


No locked ether.


No byte[].


No redundant refusal of payment.


[Bug 1ï¼“]
bug name: Style guide violation.
number of bugs: 2
row number: 93 189 
additional description: Solidity specifies how functions, events are named, and arrays are declared.
Compliance with specifications improves code readability.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 14]
bug name: Implicit visibility level
number of bugs: 21
row number: 57 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 130 136 275 
additional description: Functions that do not have a function visibility type specified
are public by default. This can lead to a vulnerability if a
developer forgot to set the visibility and a malicious user
is able to make unauthorized or unintended state changes.
And labeling the visibility explicitly makes it easier to 
catch incorrect assumptions about who can access the variable.
Bug level: warning

No using fixed point number type.


No token API violation.


No dos by failed call.


No missing constructor.


[Bug 19]
bug name: Public function that could be declared as external
number of bugs: 6
row number: 69 72 75 78 81 220 
additional description: Unused public functions in contracts can be declared external, which can reduce gas consumption.
Bug level: warning

No typographical error.


No outdated compiler version.


[Bug 22]
bug name: Use of deprecated solidity functions
number of bugs: 3
row number: 105 106 107 
additional description: Several functions and operators in Solidity are deprecated. 
Using them leads to reduced code quality. With new major versions
of the Solidity compiler, deprecated functions and operators may
result in side effects and compile errors. Please refer to https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-111 for details.
Bug level: warning

[Bug 23]
bug name: Transaction order dependence
number of bugs: 1
row number: 49 
additional description: Miners can decide which transactions are packaged into the blocks and the
order in which transactions are packaged. The current main impact of this
kind of bugs is the approve function in the ERC20 token standard.
Bug level: warning
