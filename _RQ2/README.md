# RQ2 Experiment

## Vulnerability Number Count

Workdir: `./number/`

`./number/contract_level` counts the number of vulnerabilities on contract level, suggesting that if a tool reported multiple vulnerabilities of a certain type in a contract, these vulnerabilities are considered to be only one.

## Manual Confirmation of True Positive Results

Workdir: `./manual/`

`./number/details_of_tool_results` presents the vulnerable contracts and the corresponding line number reported by tools.

`./number/labels` presents the results of manual confirmation of True Positive Results.
